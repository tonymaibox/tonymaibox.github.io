Yes, that was and is still me when we first started AJAX in our coursework. For this post, I'd like to talk about AJAX and CORS, but my thoughts here will be mostly for me (a refresher and general place to hash out thoughts, if you will).

### A Little Bit on AJAX and CORS

**AJAX** is **_Asynchronous Javascript And XML_**. The idea is to allow users interaction with a webpage without needing to reload said webpage. For instance, using an event handler, the webpage detects a user mouse button action/click on a link and the page can expand a truncated post/blurb of text or the the link can expand and load a video on the page. Using AJAX, the user can also receive and work with data from the server without having to refresh the page. These are all neat and buttery interactions that bolster user experience.

This week, the implementation seemed lost on me until I worked out some of the code with my colleagues and researched a little on a topic my instructors tangled in front of us: **_Cross-Origin Resource Sharing_** or **CORS**.

### How AJAX works

In order for AJAX to work, the web application needs to be able to receive data, dynamically change the page to display the data, and a function to help bridge these changes. Let's assume we have the following items:
  * Data - a file on our server; "text.txt"
  * Page - we'll give it a div tag with an id of "display"
  * Code - we'll javascript a bridge between the data and the page display

In the block below, we have our "text.txt" data.
<pre><code class="html">
// text.txt

This should now display on the page when we clicked on the button.
</code></pre>

Here, we have our page code and script code which I learned from w3schools mixed with some of my coursework this week. (We could opt to code the script in a _.js file and load via a script tag in the page.) Also, you'll notice that my tags/brackets are all wrong; I added a "\" in the opening tags/brackets to make my syntax highlighter work with actual code.
<pre><code>
<\!DOCTYPE html>
<\html>
<\body>

<\div id="display"><\h1>Click the button to see AJAX magic<\/h1><\/div>

<\button type="button" onclick="loadDoc()">Change Content<\/button>

<\script>
function loadDoc() {
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
      document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = this.responseText;
    }
  };
  xhttp.open("GET", "text.txt", true);
  xhttp.send();
}
<\/script>

<\/body>
<\/html>
</code></pre>

In the above script, I'm making a GET request to my local server pending there's a click on the button. When such a click happens, an XML request is made and what I've told this function to do is to change the contents in the "display" div. So, instead of "Click the button to see AJAX magic", the page should render what's in my text.txt file: "This should now display on the page when we clicked on the button." This works because I've established a link to actual data, and I've "listened" for a button click on which I'm loading the script/data ("text.txt" file). I'm reposting the above code snippet with comments to breakdown the action:
<pre><code>
<\!DOCTYPE html>
<\html>
<\body>

<\div id="display"><\h1>Click the button to see AJAX magic<\/h1><\/div>
#=> My target display/action

<\button type="button" onclick="loadDoc()">Change Content<\/button>
#=> My target trigger action

<\script>
#=> script to load (onlick="loadDoc()"; see button above)
function loadDoc() {
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
    #=> 'this' being the button, readyState being "4: request finished and response is ready" and status being "OK"
      document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = this.responseText;
      #=> connect with 'display' div, set it's innerHTML response to a string
    }
  };
  xhttp.open("GET", "text.txt", true);
  xhttp.send();
  #=> open and send the "text.txt" file to the above target display div/location.
}
<\/script>

<\/body>
<\/html>
</code></pre>

I think in going through the AJAX functionality and code(s) again, I gained a better understanding of not just what works, but how and why it works.

### How CORS works

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or COR is the access of various sources of data via AJAX methods. Originally, data was meant or only accessible via a single origin, the host domain or server. This was meant to prevent security breaches in data and web page loads (e.g. malicious scripts). Over time, the need for cross-origin resource sharing grew and security protocols improved lending way for CORS via AJAX to be possible.

The whole operation relies on the HTTP header. Simply put, a custom HTTP header allows both the browser and server to know enough about each other to determine if the request of response should succeed of fail.

The server has to allow for certain options or requests. And the client has to make an acceptable request in order to access the data. Before CORS, we were limited to make HTTP requests to our own or single server and domain. With CORS, we can direct our requests to a different server or domain if we are able to establish a good secure "handshake". Below is an example of CORS at work with updating data at a different server.

<pre><code>
    <\pre id="postResponse">
        <!-- To be populated dynamically. -->
    <\/pre>

    <\script type="text/javascript">
        // Wrap up the POST request execution.
        var makePOSTRequest = function(){
            // Make the POST request.
            $.ajax({
                type: "POST",
                url: "http://localhost:61677/some/url/resource/path",
                contentType: "application/json",
                data: JSON.stringify({
                    name: "CORS is cool!"
                }),
                dataType: "text",
                success: function( response ){
                    // Put the plain text in the PRE tag.
                    $( "#postResponse" ).text( response );
                }
            });
        };
    <\/script>
</code></pre>

Above, we're making a request to another server, url: "http://localhost:61677/some/url/resource/path". We're POST-ing new data to the server. And if succesful, we're returning that data in the PRE tag field: "CORS is cool!" This all works if the server is set up to receive and allow such a request. And the server might be specific about certain security features like cookies and authentication methods. If this is the case, there's certain commands to code into the server app to allow access. I haven't gotten that far yet into building my server and database. I'll do a follow up when that happens. Here's a sample success HTTP request header that I found on the web:

### The Power of AJAX and CORS

So, what does this all really mean? Well, the potential to communicate and manipulate other resources means you can branch out from being limited to one's own domain. This allows for API access. It would be difficult to operate on API data if one needed to be in the origin's server or domain just to use it. Instead, with CORS and AJAX, any webapp (pending any authentication required for access) can access API data. It's a win for the API server that wants to spread its brand and information services. It's a win for clients that want to access and play with data. It's a win for browsers to be able to access various data sources.
