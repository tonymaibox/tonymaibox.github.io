Testing, 1, 2, 3. [_Clears throat_]

### Development Testing

So, there's a lot of discussion or debate (depending on who you dare ask) concerning "testing" of applications or code. There's a spectrum of belief systems where on one side, there are those who rely on the mere fact that if they are building an application to work, that that in itself is the test. But this is risky because you can drive yourself down rabbit holes and forget to code core app functionalities or dismiss them because the entire process became too unwieldy. To some, this is or can be aimless:

On the other side of the spectrum, there are those who believe in testing before beginning actual lines of the application's code. That's me, I love tests. I have horrible text anxiety, but I just love the idea of a test (maybe it's my need to feel validated that attracts me to a test, or maybe it's my prior experience as a teacher in public schools that has ingrained a love for tests in me). Not everybody like tests, but I do:

### Pro-TEST

Testing at the beginning of a smaller application seems almost trivial. But laying down the "simple" tests for the small app can be fruitful. A small app can balloon into a larger application with thousands of lines of code and functions/features. For instance, the app may have started with a simple creates, shows, and/or deletes objects in the database function. It's page layout may have initially been two to three fields for entering information. But as it's userbase grows, times change, and the demands for the app to grow or evolve heightens, a simple beginning-of-development test ensures that, while the developers refactor or add to the app's code, nothing can damage the app's functions or features too severely. Without such a test or anything, it may be difficult to deduce where the problems might be especially when there's a lot of developers handling the code.

Life cycle principles like Development, Testing, Acceptance, and Production ([DTAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development,_testing,_acceptance_and_production)) maintains a strong focus on quality and customer satisfaction:

  + **Development:** App or product is being developed
  + **Testing:** App or product is passed through tests that mimick the target environment
  + **Acceptance:** App or product is passed through sample(s) of customers in their targeted usage environment
  + **Production:** App or poduct is delivered to customers

### Con-TEST

There are some individuals who feel strongly against or feel little need for testing or heavy testing in the "Testing" stage of the prdocut cycle. The sentiment is that because the app is designed for functionality that "Production" is true testing of the app's development. 

We live in an age of "patches", "hotfixes", and "updates". Having teams of developers who can address issues and respond swiftly during/after the production phase is a luxury that's becoming an expectation from both company administrators and customers. Whether or not this is a good thing is another debate.

### Mid-TEST

I guess the happy medium is moderation of the two. Overtesting can be waste of time that could be better spent for development. Afterall, the development cycle (DTAP) has several checks and balances along the way to ensure a functional product. Granted, one puts the app or product through such stages of checks and balances.

Personally, I enjoy and believe in testing. I've told my peers that if I could, I would test a test for a test that I'm testing to test another test that will test my app. Yes, I give myself testing anxiety.

But truth be told, I do see the cost-benefits in terms of time-for-testing and time-for-developing. At the very least, a bare test for the models/database's behaviors is important sprinkled with some features' tests to start.

Speaking of features tests...

### Capybara

Features tests are important if we want to ensure our web apps function as intended. This usually entails picturing or developing the user story as he or she would be using our web app.

Capybara is a Ruby on Rails gem/test that assesses the "outside" functionality of our web apps. That is, it tests our "views" or how we intend to show users the data that they request. In Rails, we use RSpec to test models and controllers' functionality, we can use Capybara to test features like paths, links, and even the returns or renders of the user and/or controller actions. For a more detailed look into and at RSpec, visit my friend, **[Dillon McRoberts's](https://dillonmcroberts.wordpress.com/)** blog post on RSpec, ["Test Driven Development with RSpec"](https://dillonmcroberts.wordpress.com/2016/08/14/rspec/).

From their documentation (which I recommend and support), Capybara is an excellent tool because:

  * **No setup necessary** for Rails and Rack application. Works out of the box.
  * **Intuitive API** which mimics the language an actual user would use.
  * **Switch the backend** your tests run against from fast headless mode to an actual browser with no changes to your tests.
  * **Powerful synchronization** features mean you never have to manually wait for asynchronous processes to complete.

### Initial Setup

To add Capybara to your Rails app, add the gem your Gemfile and run bundle install in your terminal:

<pre><code class="ruby">
gem 'capybara'
</code></pre>

You'll also need to add the following "require" line to your 'test_helper.rb' file in the usual spec folder directory of your Rails app:

<pre><code class="ruby">
require 'capybara/rails'
</code></pre>
<br />

### Drivers

Capybara uses RackTest or :rack_test as its default driver. It's fast, but has some limitations. Part of its speed is that it doesn't run Javascript, so if your app uses any .js or AJAX functions, those features can't be tested or shouldn't be included in your test methods. Also, API or OAuth requests won't be possible.

Fear not, you can switch Capybara's driver either temporarily or all together. If you're doing it temporarily, just code that in your before and/or after blocks on your test methods.

Selenium is a driver that can run javascript. Provided you have Mozilla's Firefox browser installed, when you run Selenium-based Capybara tests, a Firefox browser will run to test features functionality. You can also use Capybara-Webkit driver which runs Javascript without loading an entire browser. (Make sure to include the "capybare-webkit" gem like we did to setup Capybara in our app.) To use either drivers:

<pre><code class="ruby">
# In the test file, in the opening block or a specific block like the before and/or after block of the test, set

Capybara.default_driver = :selenium
# best used for the whole test

Capybara.current_driver = :selenium
# for before/after blocks

Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit
# to use the webkit driver

Capybara.use_default_driver
# will set the driver back to :rack_test, Capybara's default driver
</code></pre>
<br />

### Capybare with RSpec

To use Capybara with RSpec, make sure to include the following header in the spec_helper.rb file (typically in the spec folder directory of your Rails app):

<pre><code class="ruby">
require 'capybara/rspec'
</code></pre>

Testing a feature can look like this:

<pre><code class="ruby">
describe "the signin process", :type => :feature do
  before :each do
    User.create(:username => 'Me', :password => 'password')
  end

  it "signs me in" do
    visit '/sessions/new'
    within("div#signin") do
      fill_in 'Username', :with => 'Me'
      fill_in 'Password', :with => 'password'
    end
    click_button 'Sign in'
    expect(page).to have_content 'Success'
  end
end
</code></pre>

In the above example, we set a new user to be used 'before' our test condition. Then we drive the test with anticipated user actions with our app, specifically, the sign in process. We point it to the sign-in div where it should find a Username and Password field. It should then fill in those fields and reach success!

We can also test our app "views" with Capybara matchers. What should users see or what should be rendered depending on user interactions with our web apps?

<pre><code class="ruby">
RSpec.describe "games/show.html.erb", type: :view do
  it "displays the game title" do
    assign :game, Game.new(title: "Resistence")

    render

    expect(rendered).to have_css("header h1", text: "Resistence")
  end
end
</code></pre>

And that's it! There's more to testing, but I think a lot of support developers have gem-ified or evolved their methods into easier means. The test language or syntax itself is very human readable and abstracted into methods that do what you'd expect it to do. The documentation is very helpful and I suggest looking there first. I'm still very much a student of code and testing. I understand the debate between those who firmly believe in setting aside time in the beginning of development to establish good tests and those who feel testing after development or even just to leave it to the acceptance stage of the app cycle is a better use of time. I'm more of the former, except for when a closing deadline pushes me to be the latter.

Unless you're the Chuck Norris of coding, establishing a test in the beginning allows you to have some kind of test automation on a nightly or weekly schedule so you don't have to manually run your user story or leave parts of it up to assumption that it'll simply work.
